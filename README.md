# MP2A-facial-recognition-attendance-system

**Overview**

The Facial Recognition Attendance System is a mini project aimed at creating a user-friendly web-based application for managing attendance using facial recognition technology. This system eliminates the need for traditional attendance methods and provides a seamless and accurate way to track attendance using facial recognition. The project will be developed using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end.

**Technologies Used**

Flask: A Python web framework for building the back-end.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For designing and implementing the front-end user interface.
OpenCV: Used for capturing and processing images from the camera.
Facial Recognition Library: (Specify the library you intend to use for facial recognition, e.g., OpenCV's face recognition module)
MySQL: To store user profiles and attendance records.
